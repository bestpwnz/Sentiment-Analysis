Changing the rules about bounty day 3 and 4 but that's understandable and ok
its perfect and fair
T2 & T3 spawns could've been better
I think maybe the price of the bait should be only 20 shards
The changing of rules in day 3 where only 1 player can claim bounty i understand but
I think the spawns of akulaws its so hard to spawn
Akulaw is getting to difficult to spawn especially the Tier 3's which requires 30 shard per bait
Changing bounty guidelines 
I did not like when the time they refill the T2 akulaw because of it it's harder to spawn
Bounty system led to some disagreements in discord And I understand that the point of these events is to focus on those who participated in the partnership but it would be great for long term LoV players to also be able to do quest lines even if it is just for gold/items in game 
Hunt akulaw is going Existing 
There are some suspicious claims on the bounty that's took some of the fun Knowing that there might be an existing exploit happening during the event that can be unfair for players that grind fair and square
Wish the T3 Koreum was less shards seems like a lot Or if you keep it at 30 shards then it would be cool if other T3s could spawn from them like the Jinhu event  
just a little bit but over all its so nice and very good
nothing
It so hard to spawn a tier 3 akulaw
the event T3 bait price using shards 
it makes us feel not so good because mostly the RNG hit so much in many players and wasted like 1260 shards or 2k+ shards if you have 2 account then you will have no spawn hope in next event fix the RNG first before you start the event and also hope theres no bug again in next event
I think there should have been a limit of 1 bounty per person
Repetitive Almost impossible bounties ie catch 5 of each akulaw
Maybe too long for events!?
Hoarded Venari to get bounties in less than 5minutes It totally killed the fun of hunting
I think nyrie event can be improved if you modify and lessen the venari to be catched
Every time there's an event like this there's always a time where we can't access the site  Sometimes I can't access the site for a whole hour or two but some people can access it with no problem This is unfair since some players gets a head start and some already caught some of the serialized Venaris while other players like me who prepared the whole week and waited the whole day for this event cant even access the site properly
Nothing as the gameplay is limited at the moment just hoping for a faster update
Not sure at the moment 
All is really well for me on this event but as im seing some are unfortunate I think atleast giving a pity coins or something that can reward those people who got streak on no spawns even though bait is put on the right place
I like how the team made the 1 bounty per player only More chances of winning and more excitement in playing 
Bounties should be distributed evenly Most bounties were for vocari demo pass and cyberkongz holders Normal LoV players have lesser chances of getting bounties
i think it could improved theres always a room for improvement right? but overall its good
the bounty claims? its a bit confusing and there is no thorough guide for it like in the whitepaper
For me all is good
None
it could be improved
Nothing
Everything is good except T3 luring was very difficult even though we know the location I used more than 35 t3 baits and was able to tame only 3 It would be be nice if T3 spawns more often
The change of rules while the event was running bounty claim only once
The items are too expensive in middle of event i don't have gold
encountered a bug where a bait didnt spawned any venari which wasted the bait the mod saids it might be a queueing error when placing the bait
As a level 17 account I didn’t have a chance to win something I would like for beginners to have a chance
I think the devs should consider to add more bounties for people who don't have an nft that LOV's collaborating example there's only few people who owns demo kong pass which is why there's so many empty slots for demo kong owners exclusive bounty while there's so many venari player who wants to participate  or claim bounty for themselves but it's so hard because the bounty for normal players like us is limited so we must compete for it while the other exclusive bounty is up until now  is not claim even though the event will end tomorrow 
Spending this many shards and get so few spawns wasn't worth it Don't intend to participate in the next event if the spawn rates are still this frustrating
Low spawn rate Been baiting using Koreum in exact places but only caught 1 T3 Lightning Akulaw
Ability to catch other tier 2 and Tier 3 with the event bait Would allow new players to collect and see other Venari and might entice them to buy a fulltime pass
The main one will be the bug with the shop which gives a lot of players extra T3 baits to work with while the rest who are not aware of the bug can only play with 3 T3 baits daily Assuming the dynamic spawn in play and the bug I'm not surprised that 90% of my baits did not spawn a thing in the first 10 days of the event And then we have demo passes where existing players bought partner projects get extra baits and be eligible for bounties this may look like a loophole to some and myself but I'm not sure if anything can be done to improve it since people will still find way to give themselves an advantage especially with these bounties on the line Personally I will think twice before participating the next event since Jin'Hu event it's just not worth the resources to participate even if I save up a lot and with bad RNG I will get 3 T3 baits max while those with the resources to get partner projects will have extra baits daily But I would say this is part of the game too so whoever participated should be willing to take the risk of not spawning anything at all despite spending all those shards It would be difficult to balance the reward and resources needed since there are plenty of bounties so I guess it could stay the same End of the day it's still RNG to catch / be eligible to claim bounty and that's like the nature of the game don't think that it can be changed easily
"More elemental monkeys available to all
"
I like the no words can describe it
Personal experience with the release bug
It was great as it was
Not enough bounties to win The quest seemed impossible to complete 
t3 spawns are extremely bad i only spawned t3 when the increased spawn rate happened
There were no tier 2 or 3 available in low w energy zones which makes it harder for casual players to have a chance to encounter rarer venari In these events new players may struggle to unlock farther areas quick enough to have a chance for bounties or more exciting expeditions I recommend giving demo pass holders some unique spawn points that us regular players don't get to improve their experience and draw them more into LoV for the long haul Also create alpha pass ownerplayer specific bounties! This rewards people who have invested their money and their time into the game besides just vocari Only perks that exist for alpha pass owners today is a 5% bait discount but no inclusion in game development or discounts for guests vocari tickets and not even special bounties Overall I feel I like only guilded pass owners are seen as an investors into the game by the game but alpha pass buyers see themselves as investors
it was  soo could hope we will have more event
to hard to catch
None at all everything was great
maybe about the early stages of event T2 akulaw is gone so fast
more 3D featured
the event is awesome just need to optimize the UI when catching venari coz sometimes it freeze
The event needs to improve on the spawning of t3s I heard that a lot of people weren't able to spawn a tier 3 despite baiting in the confirmed locations multiple times for weeks Maybe we could have like one guaranteed t3 spawn for using 10 T3 baits or so This would make the event less reliant on the t3 rng spawns and allow everyone to have an encounter for a tier 3
Few bounties for the existing players and additional titles
I don't think there's nothing to improvise and would love to see another event like this
"Better chance to meet the t2 venari?
since the last restock i rarely got t2 venari"
hopefully better handling of bounty checks
Yes I do like it because more people are interested in catching akulaws because of the bounties
The number of Akulaws that spawned in that specific area is limited
I think spawns are wonky 😆🤣 i have a hard time spawning t3s and its not very cheap spending for t3 baits coz we're using shards to obtain them And very sad when u spent a lot and nothing spawns 
Nothing
The rules and bounty claims confusing easy to complete and claim ingame profile Also bait purchase and board travel layout
Nothing much because the team resolve quickly the problem about the t2 akulaws population 
Too limited prize categories 100 for a title bit confusing prizelayout
Set rules for Bounties that do not change all for fairness but keep it uniform
I'm not lucky in constellations in Akulaw either t2 and t3 that's why I haven't won any bounty
no t3 
"Until we get some form of the combat system it's hard to know just how useful or not a given venari would be and similarly that makes it hard to gauge the value of essences It's for this that for the time being it's very hard to decide whether or not buying T3 baits with shards is a worthwhile investment of resources as a player

I do like this form of essence sink but so long as it averages as an actual sink ie median essence cost being higher than essence value when releasing I find it hard to justify it with so many unknowns"
Sometimes the spawnrates were a bit frustrating when you were on the hunt for a special venari
Maybe decrease cost for t3 bait or drop more on catches
I think the gold is because the time of the event is very long and my gold ran out
Nothing  I think it was fairly seamless with minor hiccups
nothing all events are nice
First is the essence or shards It's really hard to get shards for t3 baits I don't think the random free t3 bait drop is enough because of the rng or we can't spawn it all the time we want it to be Second I am sure that there was a bug in buying t3 baits which is proved by my friend but I don't know why the team hided it from everyone Someone reported it that's why it was fixed but still why the first one to get the catch 100 akulaw is still considered even though we all know that he cheated I believe a community should not tolerate those actions and members being heard is what really important I just don't like the way the community team makes us look wrong or bad even if it was real Third is the rng in spawning the akulaw especially t3 I think increasing the spawn rate of t3 akulaw would be better as we spend lots of shards just to catch it Comparing the spawn rate of akulaw in oros event oros is much better
It costs SO much gold to buy all of the baits  I was saving up my gold for quite a while beforehand I had over 400k gold and still ran out of gold only by purchasing event baits oria and spica for t2 and t3 food
Not much wish I got more t3 bait dropped lol
One thing I didn't like was the changing of rules midevent about the claiming of bounties I get that you want to spread the bounties among players as much as possible but I think it would've been better if you also applied the rule wherein you can only claim one bounty regardless of the category to those who already claimed bounties before the announcement was made You could have made them choose between bounties if they claimed more than 1 then the bounties that they chose to let go should've been added to day 3 and 4 bounties for it to be fair for everyone
rules were confusing the game was a little confusing I caught an Akulaw and claimed it in the claim bounty area in discord and got a red X denied for a raffle so I didnt get it Communication on prizes felt off and yes I read the medium article I worked hard to catch the Akulaw and it felt like nothing was achieved I thought I actually had a chance for a raffle and was super excited to catch one! Now im like meh it didn't count? Super dissapointing 
Nothing i mean nothing its the best event 
I think the start of the event or update should be improved For example the t2 and t3 event baits have a wrong icon
"I liked the event and there is more to improve the problem is that we scholars are on low of shards like me so I hope that there is a minievent that t1 venaris should have shards if released 
for example venaris that are caught/tamed during october 2330 has shards if released"
There are times wherein I didn't lure any Akulaw when I placed koreum and koria baits on the places the akulaws stay  Maybe increase the chance of luring even a t1
Eu ainda estou me adaptando ao jogo 
nothing 
The horrible spawn rate and ranaway at excellent are just bad
Implementation of Rules  This isn't our fist event so we expected that all things should be iron out before the event starts Unfortunately there are sudden changes that upsets some members of the community Also if we could have a better instruction/format about the category would be better Many seekers including me were confused on how to determine categories 
I think the Tier3 Akulaw were to hard to find and catch and to few Koreum dropped from tier2 Akulaw I think the majority of people who caught Tier 3 Akulaw were running multiple accounts which is supposedly illegal 
None its the best and hoping more to the next partnered exclusive events 
play feed fight actions couldbe added to game so it will be more interesting in visual 
more $$ rofl
Odds of encountering t3s without t3 baits
Nothing 
actually the event is unfair for the new player i've been playing for 5months noe but for me its unfair because i dont have spared essence to convert to shards to buy the event t3 bait this only favor the old player i wish a more balance event for everyone
Nothing in mind right now
I think it depends on the devs for that cuz I found my self having fun
So difficult to catch a bounty reward
None so far
T3 bait too costly
Add more bounties for normal players
No i liked all the events even the one before
Quest and bounty could be made easier automatic claim or something
I don't have any dislikes on the event
"In the middle of the event the reward distribution system has changed The reason for this was the change in the award distribution system However nothing has changed for the players who were cunning before on the contrary those people continued to be advantageous After that I wanted to exchange the award I won with an award I deserved and this was not accepted It was a behavior that made your brand look bad
"
I like the eventso interesting catching AKULAW
the only thing that I think can be change in akulaw event is that you need to use shards to buy koreum
I dont see any Akulaw T3 they are super dificult to see
If you're going to force players to spend shards make sure it's worth it for them via better spawn rates
Very repetitive nothing new apart from the new venari a lot of gold grind
"I dont have but maybe the 1k cost at transfer with the different location 
Maybe it going to free during the bounty event "
I don't have any dislike about it tho
more bounty
more bounty
more bounties
nothing everything is nice marketplace soon pls
The bounty rules sudden change It's good to make 1 bounty per player but sudden change made many people regret for getting bounty that they're not so sure such as base pass They probably trying to get base pass first  and try to claim usdc later on next day bounty but they cant cause rules change But its okay cause it's still beta season right  lots to be improve to be perfect and fair
Monkey has a big booty than me 🤣
Spawn rates regarding tier 3s were quite hit or miss for a shard cost attached to the baits
the time and missions could be included to obtain exclusive venaris of that events and unique
Nothing everything is good and nice event even in drop if you catch at tier2 akulaw is very nice
its hard to win bounties 🙂
lots of imprvement
not enough bounties
Maybe the chances to get tier3 bait so that we can have chance to catch tier3
The T3 baits are so expensive almost impossible for new players to get I had to release a lot to be able to afford them 
I ran out of gold alot as i didnt know i didnt have to feed them early on
I didn't like the form of reward very complicated by discord it could be inside the site even the way to receive the rewards and usd
I really liked the Event and the only thing I can think of is maybe give more bounties to pass holders 
I didn't like was the limit of the tier2 CyberKongz because it wasted my bait and I didn't know that there was a limit because it was an event so I think next time I wont have a limit
What I don't like is that on my T3 baits I always encounter T1 Venaris
"Releasing Venari and Essence Aquisition for scholars 
    As we know when a scholar catch a venari and release it will produce essences the essences will be split between scholar and manager depends or the share but when the scholar convert that essence to shards and buy T3 event bait the manager will still get a share on the venari that he catch Which I find unfair for the scholars

Spawn rate 
    I would like to suggest to put a spawn allocation for each tamer to make it more fair

For partnership new participant 
    Maybe give them time to experience the game first before implementing the event just like a few day access so they can be familiar with the game"
i like all the event need to improve the bait that we are using to catch the venari 
Just need to make a bounty one person a bounty any days/bounty numbers to have a chance for other
I didn't like when all the T2's akulaw were caught in the middle of the week they were not enough for the number of users playing 
I like everything
I think the one that could've been improved on CyberKongz event was the spawn rate of t1 Akulaws 
being limited of baits 😅
"More than half the bounties required you to be either Vocari or a Demo pass holder
Bounty claiming could be more organized or automated
Being a Demo pass holder seems to be way too much of an advantage as they get T3 bait for free daily when it super hard for normal players to get T3 bait at all"
I liked it specially the bounties
I think no more improvement because its before good event its very nice
Nothing i think it's was good
I just didn't enjoy catching T3 Akulaw because I only spawn it twice then no show anymore I didn't catch 1 
I would like to suggest releasing t1 event Venari would give some essence even a little Like dialeddown genesis Venari But it can only give out essence during its event Since shards are hard to come by for new players unless they release their precious Venari for essence or winning giveaways
Its hard to claim the prize of the price will reddem direct inside the games not on discord
Recent update with regards to the bounty
i like the event
I want to play at hight rate
Nothing I liked it all
evolution ever
My poor spawn and catch rate
This event it's so very good and challenging for me cause i didn't expect the akulaw is exist and transfer for the other place and also the ratio is so very hard but for me this event is very nice and thanks for the legend of venari and CyberKongz 
nothing
Delay 
yes
Everything is good
Seems like the spawn rates were fairly low for the non tier one apes
Speed of bounty approval to see if you even have a chance of getting it 
Everything is smooth
NON EVENT
Nothing Everything seems fine to me
everything is fine
the event are cool
I like the new 1 per bounty event I dont like you cant claim on a alt account1 total in case your main account is unlucky
Give a little more opportunities to those who don't have NFT
I didn't think I needed to improve anything yet
everything in the event was good in my opinion but there is always something to be improved
There is always room for improvement so can I can say it could be improved
in game soacials 
none so far
None
I don't know
Ahm for me there's no event I didn't like actually I like it all I'm enjoying it
nothing
High graphics which cause lag of my phone
Nothing It went really well
Getting a T3 is just too impossible so it makes just hunting T2 pretty boring really I bought 20 T2 and 3 T3 baits every night and didnt come close to getting a bounty and only got 2 attempts at a T3of course missed both Just feels like a grind for nothing really Got a discord role out of it
So far I like the event and the only need to be improved is having more variants not only one type of venari
I did not like that they made capturing the akulaw more and more difficult 
I did not like the fact that rules were changed in the middle of the game Due to this I was not able to participate in the Day3/4 bounties I also did not like the fact that my Cyberkong quest got bugged and I lost interest because of those bugs for a while
accomodate more ppl to win prize
I think the transition between maps For me its good that we could have one click away to another location
A lots of bugs where encountered and a lot of fixing was done I was hoping if when they release the event it should be smooth bugless and final It would be better if they add more USDC/ALPHAPASS or Freely available bounties but minimize their rewards this would motivate players more to join and participate in the event knowing that theres a lot of bounties to be claimed
there's nothing i don't like
I think the event needs improvement in the future

Maybe random venari appearing when you use the bait for Akulaw
its hard to catch but i enjoy it
use too much gold new player so hard to do it
I had some tier 2 akulaw encounters where it ran away even with perfect combo
Bait T3 by shards
the event was good for those who understood the proposal It was very confusing for me even doing the quests I didn't win they should improve communication on discord there are many people from other places who don't understand what you want to share with us
podia durar mais
nothing
nothing 
"The one thing that I dislike is related to the T3 with these kinds of events the whole some people getting 3 in a row while others not being able to catch a single one in 30 baits kind of deal

Outside of the event it's okay as you only use coins and you can always try later but in this case the T3 are limited to the event and they also cost hard to obtain shards in the case of players borrowing a pass they'd need to sacrifice a bit over 8 T2 venaries per bait for example on a 50/50 share so in the end you have multiple players that spent weeks farming T1 and getting dozens of T2 in preparation for the event spending all of their essences that they could have used for something else and they get nothing out of their effort and the event ends up being a frustrating experience for them instead of a fun one due to a combination of terrible luck + hard to get baits"
more chances to win
I couldnt find T3 event venari
I hope you have also event for scholar
The went good and I always check my bait every minute when there's new catch for my baits 
I didn't even won HAHA 
Lessen the price of the bait when the events is in progress 
The bait rate from event its to hard to get 🥺
